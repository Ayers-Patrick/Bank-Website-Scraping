# Bank Website Scraping
 This script pulls all the banks and websites from thecommmunitybanker.com and puts them into a dataframe. The datafrane provides a more exhaustive source of websites for those who would want to scrape info from all banks with an online presence.

 There will be duplicates for banks in multiple states and banks with multiple names but the same URL.
